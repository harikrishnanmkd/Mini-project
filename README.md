Palliative care is a medical care that focuses on providing patients relief from 
pain and other symptoms of a serious disease. To improve the quality of life of 
both patients and their families, the palliative care team should be well 
organized. Volunteers who are willing to support this movement should be 
correctly or identified and they have to be assigned to respective teams in time. 
Funding for palliative care is a crucial element and must be efficiently collected 
and allocated to the needy.
In this project I will be creating a website that can perform the following 
functionality.
1.Donation
2.Volunteer Management
3.Patient Data Management
Palliative care mainly sustains on donations. An interface for these donations will 
improve the income as it becomes easier for donations.
Income and fund management is required for the easy management of the fund 
that is received from donations.
Volunteer management focuses on the assignment of dates for the volunteers 
considering the dates the volunteers are free.
As there is no present website or interface for palliative care, this website will 
create easier solutions to the problems like time management, resource 
management etc.

In this project, I conducted a case study of Palliative Care Alanallur of 
Palakkad district, Kerala. This case study gave more information on the working 
of palliative care â€“ how the current system in palliative care works, how 
donations are accepted, how healthcare and other services are provided etc. 
Further research and case study led to the understanding that there is a 
need for an efficient digital system for the working of palliative care which will 
make the functioning of palliative care more easier and convenient for mainly 
three types of users -Volunteer, Admin and Patient. Also, there is another user 
i.e. the donator. The donor donates money to the palliative care which will be 
used for the functioning of the palliative care. 
By the implementation of this project, the palliative care will have a 
website which will accept donations, manage volunteers, and also the patients. 
Patients and volunteers can register through Digipal and the admin can verify 
the data provided by the patients and accept or reject the application of the 
patient. 
The implementation of this website in palliative care will make the 
functions of the palliative care more efficient and easier for all the stakeholders
